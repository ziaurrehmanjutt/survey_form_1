              <p><b>In Pursuit of Happiness: The Why Start-Up?</b></p>
              <p>Dear start-up (co-)founder or employee,</p>
              <p>At the Institute of Entrepreneurship and Innovation Science at the <b>University of Stuttgart</b>, we conduct empirical research on topics relating to new venture teams' culture and personal motivations. This is especially important as ongoing research shows that specific personality traits lead to different outcomes. For example, current research shows that teams with a common identity increase their chance of survival, whereas heterogeneous teams are more likely to dissipate.</p>

              <p>
                We know that time is a precious thing, especially for you. That is why we only ask you for approximately 20 min of it. Furthermore,
                <b>, if you share the survey link and participate with at least two more co-workers in this survey and add your team's name at the end, we will send you an exposé on your team evaluation.</b>
                It consists of a comparison of your team to other start-ups (from your industry), and you'll be able to assess whether your team finds
                <b>meaning and purpose </b>
                in their work and how the
                <b>dynamics and engagement</b>
                of your team are.
              </p>

              <p>Participation in the survey is voluntary, and we guarantee that the results will be stored and evaluated anonymously. This makes it 

              <b>impossible to relate it to you or your company. </b>
              . If you voluntarily enter your team's name, this information will be stored separately and will only be used to send you the individual results. Afterward, this data will be deleted. This makes sure that no one can identify the person or company behind the data points. The information you'll provide will be used anonymously for scientific purposes and published in high-ranking academic journals.

              </p>
